If clinicians identify patients with a rash that could be consistent with monkeypox, especially those with a recent travel history to central or west African countries, parts of Europe where monkeypox has been reported, or other areas reporting monkeypox cases, monkeypox should be considered as a possible diagnosis.
The rash associated with monkeypox involves vesicles or pustules that are deep-seated, firm or hard, and well-circumscribed; the lesions may umbilicate or become confluent and progress over time to scabs.
Presenting symptoms typically include fever, chills, the distinctive rash, or new lymphadenopathy; however, onset of perianal or genital lesions in the absence of subjective fever has been reported.
The rash associated with monkeypox can be confused with other diseases that are more commonly encountered in clinical practice (e.g., secondary syphilis, herpes, chancroid, and varicella zoster).  However, a high index of suspicion for monkeypox is warranted when evaluating people with a characteristic rash, particularly for men who report sexual contact with other men and who present with lesions in the genital/perianal area or for individuals reporting a significant travel history in the month before illness onset or contact with a suspected or confirmed case of monkeypox.
Information on infection prevention and control in healthcare settings is provided on the CDC website Infection Control: Hospital | Monkeypox | Poxvirus | CDC.  CDC is currently reviewing this information to consider the need for updates.
Clinicians should first consult their state health department (State Contactsexternal icon) or CDC through the CDC Emergency Operations Center (770-488-7100) as soon as monkeypox is suspected.
All specimens should be sent through the state/territorial public health department, unless authorized to send them directly to CDC.
